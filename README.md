A website portfolio of Donald D. Brown running for the Judge of Poughkeepsie

This was the first website I ever built, cut me some slack. No framework, just pure html and css.
I built this website in about a month from not knowing any html and css to this. I know I can out do myself
and would update the website, but I prefer to archive this as a memory...
