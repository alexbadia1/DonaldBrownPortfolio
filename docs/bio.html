                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My career in private practice has been, until the
                    last few years, rewarding, stimulating,
                    gratifying and often joyful. We had a firm which was a lot like family. We had a number of
                    employees who worked for us for 20-30 years. It was a great place to work! I loved practicing
                    law for most of my career. I always considered myself so fortunate to have almost stumbled into
                    a career that I was good at, and that actually helped people and that I loved to do! I have tried
                    jury cases literally from coast-to-coast and even in a foreign country (Israel in 1992). I have
                    represented some absolutely wonderful clients; many of whom became life-long friends. I have
                    represented movie stars, professional athletes and I have regularly represented, throughout my
                    career, persons who could not afford an attorney on a pro bono basis. Several of them have
                    become life-long friends, as well. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was educated and trained in the law by some
                    wonderful, wonderful teachers. Those I
                    served with early in my career belong to different political parties; but that is of absolutely no
                    matter. Some are still-sitting federal judges that I went to school with. Some are recently retired
                    Judges from whom I learned much while working side-by-side with them in the D.A.’s Office
                    (Al Rosenblatt, George Marlow, Jerry Hayes, Tom Dolan, Steve Greller , Jerry Pisanelli, Jim
                    Brands, Ira Pergament, Joe Spiegel). I am “old school”. I was taught and I believe that lawyers
                    are <u>public servants</u>. I was taught and I believe that the courts do not exist for the
                    government.
                    <u>The courts exist and derive their authority to serve the people; that they administer the law for
                        the people not for the government</u>.
                </p>

                <p class="home-details"> I was fortunate to serve my profession and my community in many voluntary
                    capacities
                    and I enjoyed them all (or I’ve purged from my memory those I didn’t). Among them:</p>

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost 36 years ago, following the sudden deaths of
                    my 14-year old daughter and my father,
                    I entered a treatment program for recovery for my then untreated alcoholism. Since that time, I
                    have remained an active member/participant in that recovery program and I have remained
                    completely abstinent from alcohol and drugs since that time. I have served for almost 20 years on
                    the NYS Bar Assn Comm. on Lawyer Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (now “Lawyers
                    Assistance Program”) and have spoken with and counseled, at the request of the State and local
                    bar associations, groups of lawyers and individual lawyers on this subject. More importantly, I
                    have worked with, and continue to do so regularly, men of all ages and backgrounds, and their
                    families, who are recovering/struggling to recover from alcoholism/addiction. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In April of 2018 I decided to retire from the
                    practice of law. The decision was not an easy
                    one; but it was 4-5 years in coming. As a trial lawyer, I had to deal with the government and the
                    insurance industry virtually every day. The system which I grew up in is now broken and the
                    way that lawyers are trained today is not the way they were trained formerly. As I said, I am “old
                    school”. It seems that the government and the courts perceive that they exist for the institutions
                    themselves and not for the people for whom they should be serving. I saw far too many
                    meritorious cases become bogged down in meaningless delays for endless discovery requests.
                    Court orders were ignored because judges didn’t want to lean too hard on big companies with big
                    law firms; so the system just started grinding to a halt. My clients had no practical remedy
                    because the cost of litigation was skyrocketing. It was demoralizing to tell my clients the truth
                    about this system and have them look at me with eyes that said: “Well, you’re a part of this
                    system, aren’t you?” I couldn’t come up with a good response to that; so I had to leave. I
                    couldn’t just stay around any longer, just for the money. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I kept my license in case I could use it one day to
                    be of some service. I’m big on service.
                    The local Democratic Committee asked me to consider running. I thought about; and, candidly,
                    my first reaction was: ‘What do I want to do that for? I’m enjoying my 3 wonderful
                    granddaughters and visiting and spending time with old friends and family who live all over the
                    country.” Then after conferring with my fiancé’ and my son (also a lawyer) and giving it some
                    more thought, I felt that I certainly know the job and I know that I have the best qualifications
                    and plenty of time to do the job right. I also know that those now in the job are there because
                    they’ve been holding political office in the town for 25-40 years. To me, that’s not what public
                    service is supposed to be about.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So…..I feel that this is what I’m called to do, to
                    be of service now; and I pledge my full
                    commitment to the citizens of the town to do the job right and to give it all the time and energy it
                    takes. I am not committed to getting myself off the bench and out of there each day, as quickly as
                    I can, to get back to my personal business or law practice.

                    Early Years
                </h1>

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am the son and grandson of NYC Firemen. My great
                    uncle, Jim was a Battalion Chief in the FDNY when I was a kid. I am the oldest of 6, born in Brooklyn and attended school
                    on Long Island. I first came to Poughkeepsie in 1964 to attend Marist College graduating in
                    1968. While there, I always say “I got a great education despite myself”. studied extremely hard
                    my first and last years; and in the middle, I was involved in music and football (not so much
                    academics). I worked part-time throughout college and full-time at IBM at nights in my senior
                    year in, what was then, the South Road Lab. By the time I graduated, I had married a
                    Poughkeepsie girl and we had a new-born baby daughter. I had always assumed that I would be
                    entering the service upon graduation (as this was the height of the Viet Nam War); and now, I
                    suddenly had a permanent draft deferment due to my status as a father. So, while my new wife
                    entered the first class of women at Marist to complete her final year of her degree, I managed to
                    secure a position as a Probation Officer in the Dutchess County Probation Dept. It was there that
                    fate stepped in. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although I had an uncle who was a lawyer, I was the
                    first in my family (other than him)
                    to go to college. I had never given thought to Law School. In my job in probation, I would often
                    go to court on Thursday, as that was the day we would file Violation Petitions for recalcitrant
                    probationers. I would watch the lawyers appear and plead their clients’ cases before the judges
                    and it struck me that I was at least as smart as any of them (and probably smarter than most).
                    So…..I took what they called the Law Boards in those days (today they call them the LSATS)
                    and also took the exam for the NYPD. I was accepted into St. John’s Univ. Law School (then in
                    downtown Brooklyn) and called down for my NYPD physical the same week. This was a big
                    turning point. Although St. John’s offered me a full scholarship, they had a rule prohibiting law
                    students from holding any kind of job, even part-time, while attending law school for 3 years. I
                    had a wife and child to support! A boyhood friend of mine who was finishing up his first year at
                    St. John’s Law told me that he knew that they couldn’t enforce the rule. So…..I entered law
                    school, found a full-time job working 4 p.m. to midnight 5-6 nights a week for the Office of
                    Probation of the City of New York as a Sr. Investigator in the Criminal Courts in Manhattan and
                    Brooklyn. We, basically, interviewed prisoners prior to arraignment, as well as their families,
                    employers, landlords, etc. trying to establish if they had sufficient ties to the community to
                    recommend that they be released on their own recognizance or not. This was a tough slog for 3
                    years, but the job was only a short subway ride from school and we had the opportunity to study
                    for a few hours a night on the job, during lull hours. At the end of the 3 years, I graduated #2 out
                    of 355 in my law school class and secured a very prestigious clerkship in the Appellate Division
                    of the New York State Supreme Court in Albany for a year. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nearing the end of the clerkship year in Albany, I
                    had a lot of “sexy” (read “$$$ and
                    prestige) offers in Albany, NYC and Wash., D.C.; however, I met the then District Attorney of
                    Dutchess County (later Chief Admin. Judge of the State of N.Y. and Judge of the N.Y. Court of
                    Appeals), Albert M. Rosenblatt at a social gathering. Al, who was to become my mentor, knew
                    about my background and early achievements and told me that if I wanted to “earn my chops” as
                    a trial lawyer, I could come on to his staff as an Asst. D.A. He promised I wouldn’t make much
                    money (and he wasn’t lying!); but I’d get more experience than anywhere else. So…. I took a
                    job for $5,500 a year less than I had earned in my first job out of law school and moved back to
                    Poughkeepsie to become the Asst. D.A. assigned to the Town of Poughkeepsie Court. In that
                    position, I handled all criminal cases from arrest through trial, from shoplifting to murder. While
                    I had my formal office within the D.A.’s Office in the County Courthouse, I spent most of my
                    time at the Town Court and the Town Police Station, working with the Town Justices (Jack King
                    and Abe Banner) and the Town Police. We used to joke that I was “counsel to the Town Police”.
                    Not that I rubber-stamped everything they did or wanted to do; but we worked very closely and
                    consulted constantly to make airtight cases stick and to keep bad cases out of the system. I would
                    get phone calls at all hours of the night from the detectives and the uniformed patrols with
                    questions, etc; and that was the way I and they wanted it. On weekends, if nothing else was
                    going on, I’d ride on patrol with them. I loved the job! <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, 4 ½ years after graduating I was
                    making $13,500 and my wife and I had
                    just purchased a first house in Millbrook for $32,500 and were hoping to have another child. One
                    simply couldn’t support a family on an Asst. D.A.’s salary in those days. So….I joined a
                    Poughkeepsie law firm which included Joe Spiegel, Ira Pergament, two former Asst. D.A.s and
                    Town Justices (Ira/Town of Poughkeepsie; Joe/Town of LaGrange). I practiced there for almost
                    40 years, rising to the leadership position in the firm. I left the D.A.’s office and joined the
                    firm
                    at the beginning of 1976, when Al Rosenblatt went on the bench. At the same time, I was
                    elected as Town Justice in the Town of Washington out in Millbrook, where I served for 4 years,
                    (moving back to Poughkeepsie in 1980).
