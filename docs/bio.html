                    Early Years
                </h1>

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am the son and grandson of NYC firefighters, and
                    my great uncle was a
                    battalion chief in the FDNY. The eldest of six children in my family, I was born
                    in Brooklyn and educated on Long Island. I first came to Poughkeepsie in 1964
                    to attend Marist College, from which I graduated in 1968. At Marist, I always
                    say, “I got a great education despite myself.” I studied extremely hard my
                    freshman and senior years, but in those middle years I was more deeply
                    involved in music and football than in academics. Throughout my years at
                    Marist I also worked part-time; as a senior I worked a full-time night shift at
                    what was then IBM’s South Road Lab. <br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time I graduated, I was married to a
                    Poughkeepsie
                    girl and we had a new-born daughter. Having always assumed that upon graduation I would be drafted
                    to serve
                    in the Vietnam War, I instead had a permanent draft deferment due to my status as a father. So
                    while my new
                    wife entered the first class of women at Marist College, I secured a position as a Dutchess County
                    probation
                    officer. And it was there that fate stepped in. <br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although I had an uncle who was a lawyer, when I
                    became just the second member of my extended family to attend college I did so without any
                    consideration
                    of a career in law. But in my job in probation, I often went to court on Thursdays when violation
                    petitions
                    for recalcitrant probationers were filed. I would watch lawyers appear and plead their clients’
                    cases before
                    judges, and it struck me that I was at least as smart as any of them (and probably smarter than
                    most). So I
                    took what were then called the “Law Boards” (now know as the “LSATS”) as well as the exam for the
                    NYPD.
                    During the same week, I received my acceptance into St. John’s University Law School and was called
                    down for
                    NYPD physical exam. This was a major turning point for me. <br>


                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though St. John’s offered me a full scholarship,
                    the university at that time
                    prohibited law students from holding even part-time employment – and I had
                    a wife and child to support. But a friend who was finishing up his first year at
                    the law school assured me the no-employment rule couldn’t be enforced. So I
                    entered law school and took a job as a senior investigator for the Office of
                    Probation of the City of New York, working five or six nights a week in the
                    Manhattan and Brooklyn criminal courts. Basically, I interviewed prisoners as
                    well as their families, employers, landlords, and others to establish if they had

                    sufficient community ties to recommend to the arraigning judge that they be
                    released on their own recognizance. It was tough work, but the job was a
                    short subway ride from school and it allowed me to study a few hours each
                    night during down time on the job. At the end of three years, I graduated from
                    St. John’s ranked second out of 355 students in my law school class, and I
                    secured a prestigious one-year clerkship in the Appellate Division of the New
                    York State Supreme Court in Albany. <br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nearing the end of my clerkship, I received job
                    offers in Albany, New York, and
                    Wash., D.C., that offered good pay and prestige. But at a social gathering I had
                    the great fortune to meet Albert M. Rosenblatt, then the District Attorney of
                    Dutchess County and later the Chief Administrative Judge of the State of New
                    York and Judge of the state Court of Appeals. Al, who was to become my
                    mentor, knew my background and of my early achievements. He advised that
                    if I wanted to “earn my chops” as a trial lawyer, I could join his staff as an
                    assistant district attorney. He promised that, though I wouldn’t earn much
                    money, I’d gain more valuable experience than anywhere else. So I accepted
                    his offer of a job as the assistant district attorney assigned to the Town of
                    Poughkeepsie Court. In that position I handled all criminal cases, ranging from
                    shoplifting to murder, from arrest through the trial process. <br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While my office was in the Dutchess County
                    Courthouse, I spent most of my
                    time at the town court and police station, working with Town Justices Jack
                    King and Abe Banner and the local police. We used to joke that I was “counsel
                    to the Town Police.” It wasn’t that I rubber-stamped everything officers
                    wanted to do, but we worked closely together and consulted constantly to
                    make airtight cases stick and to keep bad cases out of the justice system. I took
                    phone calls at all hours of the day and night from detectives and uniformed
                    officers, and I spent many weekends riding patrol with them. <br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved that job, but nearly five years after having
                    graduating second in my law
                    school class I was making only $13,500 a year. My wife and I had just bought
                    our first house in Millbrook and we were hoping to have another child; we
                    simply couldn’t support a family on an assistant D.A.’s salary. So in 1976, the
                    same year I was elected to a four-years term as Town Justice in the Town of
                    Washington, I joined a Poughkeepsie law firm whose staff included Joe Spiegel
                    and Ira Pergament, two men who also had been assistant D.A.s and town
                    justices in the Poughkeepsie area. I practiced law there for almost 40 years,
                    rising to the leadership position in the firm. <br>

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My career in private practice has been rewarding,
                    stimulating, gratifying and
                    often joyful. Our firm was a great, family-like place to work, with several
                    employees with us for more than 20 years. I have loved practicing law and
                    consider myself fortunate to have somewhat stumbled into a career that has
                    allowed me to excel while helping many people. I have tried jury cases from
                    coast to coast and even once in Israel in 1992. I have represented many
                    wonderful clients, some of whom became life-long friends. While I have
                    represented a few movie stars and professional athletes, I much more
                    frequently have represented people who could only receive legal services on a
                    pro bono basis. Several of these people have become life-long friends as well. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was trained in the law by some wonderful
                    teachers. Those I served with
                    early in my career belong to different political parties. Some are still-sitting
                    federal judges who I went to school with, while others are recently-retired
                    judges from whom I learned much while working with them in the D.A.’s
                    office, including Al Rosenblatt, George Marlow, Jerry Hayes, Tom Dolan, Steve
                    Greller, Jerry Pisanelli, Jim Brands, Ira Pergament, and Joe Spiegel.<br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am “old school.” I believe, as I was taught, that
                    lawyers are public servants,
                    that the courts exist and derive their authority from the people, and that the
                    courts administer the law for the people rather than for the government.

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost 36 years ago, following the sudden deaths of
                    my 14-year-old daughter and my father,
                    I entered a treatment program for recovery for my then untreated alcoholism. Since then I have
                    remained an active participant in that recovery
                    program and maintained my complete abstinence from alcohol and drugs. For almost 20 years I have
                    served on the New York State Bar Association’s
                    Committee on Lawyer Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (now called the “Lawyers Assistance Program”). In
                    this capacity I have counseled individuals
                    and addressed groups of lawyers on this subject. More importantly, I have worked with – and continue
                    to do so regularly – men of all ages and their
                    families who are struggling to recover from alcoholism and drug addiction. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In April 2018 I decided to retire from the practice
                    of law. The decision was not an easy one.
                    As a trial lawyer, I had to deal with the government and the insurance industry virtually every day.
                    The system I grew up in is now broken, and
                    the way in which lawyers are trained today is not the way they were trained formerly. As noted
                    earlier, I am “old school,” and it seems to me
                    the government and the courts perceive that they exist for the institutions themselves and not for
                    the people those institutions are intended to
                    serve. I have seen far too many meritorious cases become bogged down in meaningless delays for
                    endless discovery requests. Court orders were ignored
                    because judges didn’t want to lean too hard on big companies with big law firms; so the system
                    started grinding to a halt. My clients
                    had no practical remedy because the cost of litigation was skyrocketing. It was demoralizing to tell
                    my clients the truth about this
                    system and to have them look at me with eyes that said, “Well, you’re a part of this system, aren’t
                    you?” I couldn’t come up with a good
                    response to that; so I had to leave. I couldn’t stay around any longer just for the money. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I kept my law license in case I could use it one
                    day to be of some service; I’m big on service.
                    So when the local Democratic Committee asked me to consider running for judge, I gave it long and
                    serious thought. To be quite candid, my
                    initial reaction was, “What do I want to do that for? I’m enjoying my three wonderful
                    granddaughters, and I’m visiting and spending time
                    with old friends and family who live all over the country.” But after conferring with my fiance’ and
                    my son, who also is a lawyer, I was
                    convinced that I know the job of a judge and I know I have the best qualifications and plenty of
                    time to do the job right. I also know
                    that those now on the local bench are there because they’ve been holding political office in this
                    town for 25 to 40 years. To me that
                    is not reason enough and surely not what public service is supposed to be about.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I believe this is what I’m called to do to be
                    of service right now. And I pledge my full
                    commitment to you and to all the citizens of the Town of Poughkeepsie that I will devote the time
                    and energy needed to the do the job right.
