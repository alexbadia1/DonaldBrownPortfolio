                            The decision was not an easy one;
                            but it was 4-5 years in coming. I kept my license in case I could use it one day to be of
                            service.
                            I was asked by the local democratic committee to run for Town of Poughkeepsie Justice. After
                            much consideration I decided that this is what I am called to do right now. I know the job.
                            I know
                            I have the best qualifications for the job and I pledge my full commitment, to the citizens

                <p class="home-details">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the past 20 years, I have received the highest
                    rating from judges and
                    other attorneys from the Martindale-Hubbell rating agency, the nation’s
                    sole independent, confidential peer-review system. Its highest rating (AV) is
                    based upon an attorney’s ethics and legal ability. Fewer than 3 percent of all
                    attorneys in the United States have ever received the AV rating.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps I am best qualified for the job of Town
                    Justice in Poughkeepsie
                    because I’ve stood in the shoes of every person who comes before this
                    court. I am a former Town Judge (in Millbrook), a former assistant district
                    attorney in the Town of Poughkeepsie, and a former probation worker in
                    Dutchess County, Brooklyn and Manhattan. I also have represented clients
                    before the Town Court and even been a defendant in a Town Court (in 1966
                    case involving a minor traffic violation).
                    <img src="images/mugShot.jpg" alt="mugShot" class="mugShot">
                    In 1966, in my sophomore
                    year at Marist, I received a ticket for a traffic infraction and the judge imposed a sentence
                    of “$25 or 3 days”. In 1966, I had a part-time job which paid a lot less than $25 a month;
                    so I asked for a week so that I could call my parents to ask them to send me the fine
                    money. He refused the request and sent me off to 3 days in the Dutchess County Jail. (If
                    you doubt this, just check out the mug shot on this site which I later retrieved with the
                    help of a detective friend from the Sheriff’s Office years, later during my DA days). <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result of these many and varied experiences, I
                    have developed the key
                    qualities needed of a fair and effective Town Justice – patience, wisdom, and
                    good judgment. While many may overlook the significance of this position, I
                    am well aware of its importance to those who come before the Town Court.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, my best qualification may well be that
                    <strong>I am not a politician</strong>. I seek only to do the job of Town Justice
                    the way I know it should be done. I am well aware that the Town of
                    Poughkeepsie’s is the busiest part-time court between White Plains and
                    Albany. After my family, service to this court will be my top priority. Yes, it
                    is a part-time job, but I promise to give it my full-time commitment.
