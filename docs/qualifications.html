                        but it was 4-5 years in coming. I kept my license in case I could use it one day to be of service.
                        I was asked by the local democratic committee to run for Town of Poughkeepsie Justice. After
                        much consideration I decided that this is what I am called to do right now. I know the job. I know
                        I have the best qualifications for the job and I pledge my full commitment, to the citizens of the
                        Town of Poughkeepsie to do the job right and to give it all the time and energy it takes”.</i></span>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the past 20 years, I have received the highest
                    rating from Judges and other
                    attorneys from the Martindale-Hubbell rating agency which is the only truly independent,
                    confidential peer review system in the country for over 70+ years. It’s highest rating
                    (AV) is based upon Ethics and Legal Ability. Less than 3% of all attorneys in the U.S.
                    have ever received the AV rating (which is updated every 2 years). I am most proud of
                    this AV recognition. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the reason that I am best qualified for the
                    job of Town Justice in
                    Poughkeepsie, aside from the fact that I’ve lived here for most of the past 50 years,
                    attended college here, coached Little League and practiced law here, is that <u>I’ve stood in
                        the shoes of every person who comes before the Town.</u> I am a former Town Judge (in
                    Millbrook, where I lived for 5 years after I left the D.A.’s Office), a former Asst. D.A. in
                    the Town of Poughkeepsie, working 50-60 hours a week with the Judges, court personnel
                    and, particularly, the Town Police Department. I spent 4 years in Probation, working a
                    year in Dutchess Co. and then 3 ½ years working 4 p.m. to midnights in the Criminal
                    Courts in Brooklyn and Manhattan for the NYC Office of Probation while attending law
                    school days. I’ve represented clients before the Town Court from time to time over the
                    years, as well. I have even been a defendant in a Town Court. 
                    <img src="images/mugShot.jpg" alt="mugShot" class="mugShot">
                    In 1966, in my sophomore
                    year at Marist, I received a ticket for a traffic infraction and the judge imposed a sentence
                    of “$25 or 3 days”. In 1966, I had a part-time job which paid a lot less than $25 a month;
                    so I asked for a week so that I could call my parents to ask them to send me the fine
                    money. He refused the request and sent me off to 3 days in the Dutchess County Jail. (If
                    you doubt this, just check out the mug shot on this site which I later retrieved with the
                    help of a detective friend from the Sheriff’s Office years, later during my DA days). <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The point, of course, is that the job of Town
                    Justice requires someone with some
                    patience, wisdom and <u> good judgment </u> (which that certain unnamed, and now long-
                    deceased jurist, lacked). The job I am running for is not a “big job”; but it is an important
                    job. Important to the people who have need to come into or before that court.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, my best qualification may well be that
                    <strong>I am not a politician</strong>. I did not seek
                    this job. I was asked. I did not always want to be the Town Justice in the Town of
                    Poughkeepsie. I retired from my law practice after 42 years, last April. I retained my law
                    license in the event that I might use it one day to be of service in some way. I have been
                    fortunate to have enjoyed a long and successful career and my career is over. I am no
                    politico. I am interested only in being of some useful service to my family, friends and
                    community. I seek no other job (political or otherwise). I seek no particular status. <strong> I am
                        beholden to no party nor individuals. I seek only to do the job the way it should be
                        done. I know the job quite well and how it should be done. </strong> I know that it is the
                    busiest
                    part-time court between White Plains and Albany. After my family, it will be my priority.
                    it is a part time job and I will give it a a full-time commitment.
